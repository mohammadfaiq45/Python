# Python Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to my Python Data Analysis repository! This repository showcases various data analysis projects where I leverage Python and its libraries to extract meaningful insights from diverse datasets. Each project includes data exploration, visualization, and conclusion, helping in data-driven decision-making.

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. Diwali Sales Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from a Diwali festival sale. The aim is to identify key patterns in customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and popular product categories.

#### Key Insights:
- **Gender**: Majority of the buyers are females with higher purchasing power.
- **Age**: Most buyers are aged between 26-35 years.
- **Location**: The highest sales and orders come from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.
- **Marital Status**: Married women dominate the buyer segment.
- **Occupation**: Buyers are mostly from the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors.
- **Product Preferences**: Food, Clothing, and Electronics are the most sold product categories.

#### Conclusion:
Businesses targeting married women aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, particularly those working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, can maximize their sales by focusing on Food, Clothing, and Electronics.

### 2. Student Result Analysis

This project analyzes student test score data to identify key factors influencing academic performance. The aim is to determine which features most significantly affect test scores and to explore any interactions between these features.


#### Key Insights:
- **Parental Education**: Higher levels of parental education are strongly correlated with better test scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.
- **Weekly Study Hours**: Students studying more than 10 hours per week demonstrate significantly higher scores compared to their peers.
- **Gender**: Female students tend to achieve higher scores than male students in all subjects.
- **Sports Participation**: Regular involvement in sports has a positive effect on test performance, suggesting a link between physical activity and academic success.
- **Marital Status**: The analysis concludes that the marital status of parents has little to no impact on students' scores.
- **Math Performance**: Through this analysis, it is evident that most students are weak in the Math subject.
- **Ethnic Group**: Group C has the largest representation, indicating potential demographic influences on performance.

#### Conclusion:
To enhance student performance, educational strategies should focus on engaging parents in their children's education, promoting effective study habits, and encouraging physical activity. Targeting interventions based on demographic insights, particularly for students from Group C, can further optimize academic outcomes.
